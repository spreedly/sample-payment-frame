# sample-payment-frame

An example implementation of a payment page using the Spreedly iFrame payment collection form.

You can see this form live at [https://spreedly-payment-frame.herokuapp.com](https://spreedly-payment-frame.herokuapp.com).

All logic is contained in `index.html`. The other files in this repo
exist to support deploying this app to Heroku. If you've cloned the
repo locally, you can just open `index.html` in your browser.
